Yury graduated from the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics (BSUIR) in 2015 with a degree in “Radio-Electronic Systems” of the Radio Engineering and Electronics Department and also holds a Master's degree in technical sciences. He is currently engaged in scientific work as part of a postgraduate course at BSUIR majoring in “Mathematical support and software for computing machines, systems and computer networks”, Information Technology Software Division, Computer Networks and Systems Department.

Yury is an expert in the field of digital signal processing. His area of expertise is the development of methods for condition monitoring of industrial equipment based on vibration signal analysis. He heads the department of digital signal processing of VibroBox team. He is engaged in the development of adaptive filtering algorithms, wavelet, and spectral analysis, construction of classifiers based on fuzzy logic and decision-making devices based on trend analysis. Mr. Aslamov also researches the domain of informative features of the defective equipment. He has experience in applying machine learning to vibration diagnostics. He is involved in verifying the telemetry collection system developed by the VibroBox team.

The theme of Master's thesis: “Picking-up and processing of visual information from CMOS array to solve detection problem”.
